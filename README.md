PROJECT TITLE: Knapsack3D
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of the project is to fill a 3D knapsack to the best of our abilities using both Cuboids and Pentominoes
VERSION or DATE:v.1.2.5, 22/01/2024
-----------------------------------
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Download the zip file and unzip it. Open the unzipped folder in Studio Visual Code or any IDE of your choice. 
Compiling the UI.java file will open up a Graphical Menu through which the user is able to decide which Algorithm to run.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: The Start Screen contains three options. Two Start options which if pressed will give the player the ability to run the Algorithms with 
their respective pieces, and an Exit option, which does as the name implies. Regardless of which Start button is pressed, the user will be greeted by another
menu which showcases the 3D renders of the pieces and the choice to run one of two different Algorithms, which read "FOR FILL" and "FOR SCORE". "FOR FILL"
will try to find a solution that leaves empty as few positions possible and "FOR SCORE" a solution that maximizes score regardless of the amount of empty 
spaces that it leaves. After the execution of the code the user is free to rotate the piece, using the mouse, and look at the layout of the outermost layer. When finished 
the user can close the window and run the program again to run the other options.
